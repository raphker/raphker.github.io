_L'Hectare et la grenouille_ presents the work of 9 artists from the Ateliers Voltaire. Invited to curate their recent creations, Elora Weill-Engerer proposed a dialogue between their works and those of three other artists. Based on a parodic title by La Fontaine, L'hectare et la grenouille conjures up pairs of notions that collide and combine in the artworks: the large and the small, science and nature, man and animal.
