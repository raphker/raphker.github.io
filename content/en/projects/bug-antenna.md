description: |
  Bug Antenna consists of two telescopic antennas. The apparatus reacts to the intensity and numbers of Wi-Fi networks present in the space. The movement is similar to that of an insect's antennae, seeking to probe and interact with its environment. The antennae are diverted from their original mode of operation to make the room's wireless activity perceptible. The more activity there is in the networks, the more the system is active.

  _Programming developed in collaboration with Didier Bouchon._
