description: |
  Omnipresent in our environment, copper wire is the primary medium for transporting energy and conducting electricity. It is the image of the technical object in its simplest form. 

  The three heliogravures depict cross-sections of electric cables in their original size. Taken from the plates, several prints are obtained using a copper oxide pigment. This pigment, made from oxidized electrical wire, evokes the plasticity of cables in their raw materiality.
