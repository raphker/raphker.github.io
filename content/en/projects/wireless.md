  Triptych of electromagnetic radiation pattern, digital print in PLA.  

  Dimensions of parts:\
  n°1, 2, 3: 21x21x22cm / 16x16x26cm / 23x23x20cm.\
  n°4, 5, 6: 25x22x22cm / 24x22x27cm / 26x18x22cm.
description: |
  These pieces have been modelized according to the electromagnetic radiation of three Wi-Fi antennas. The three-dimensional shapes reveal the main emission lobes characteristic of each antenna. These impressions take on the counter-form of the electromagnetic field emanating from the antennas. They allow us to perceive the geometry of our wireless communications flows.

  _Project developed within the SACRe-PSL /EnsAD doctoral program._
