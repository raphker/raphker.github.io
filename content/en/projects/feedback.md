description: |
  This apparatus uses a feedback loop as its generating principle. A microphone records the sounds emitted when data is recorded on a hard disk. The microphone's capture is recorded directly onto the disk. The sound recording itself becomes the source of its own recording, a dialogue between the medium and the nature of the information generated. The installation questions the constant passage of information from digital to analog.
