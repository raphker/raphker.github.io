Raphaëlle Kerbrat is a visual artist and PhD graduate from SACRe - PSL / École des Arts Décoratifs de Paris.

In her work, Raphaëlle Kerbrat explores the condition and material challenges of digital technology, through a physical manipulation of its supports. The artifacts she develops raise the paradox of digital "immateriality" in relation to the physical imprint of the infrastructures that support it. By weaving a dialogue between art, science and technology, she aims to make the imperceptible visible, through devices that reveal digital materialities in a sensitive and poetic way.

Her work has been exhibited in several solo shows: at the Centre Pompidou for her doctoral thesis defense exhibition "Le poids des données" in 2023, and for the exhibition "Paysages Immatériels" presented at the A.N.A.S by SIANA in 2021. She has also taken part in several group shows, including the 64th Salon de Montrouge (2019) and the 71st Jeune Création (2021), at the MIAM (2023), Gaîté Lyrique (2023), Cité Internationale des Arts (2018), and Lieu Unique (2016)... In parallel with her visual work, she teaches and works with students to introduce them to digital practices in the field of art and design.
