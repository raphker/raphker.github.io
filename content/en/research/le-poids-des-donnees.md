This thesis was prepared within the framework of the doctoral program Sciences, Arts, Création, Recherche of the Paris Sciences et Lettres University (SACRe- PSL) at the École des Arts Décoratifs, under the supervision of Samuel Bianchini (École des Arts Décoratifs), Pierre Kerfriden (Mines Paris - PSL) and co-supervised by David Bihanic (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne).

**Issue** : Within the context of environmental crisis, which is now bringing into focus the paradoxes of an immaterial digital condition, what role can art play in the sensory awareness of digital materialities and the processes involved in processing and transmitting data flows?

**Principal aims** : This practice-based doctoral research aims to experiment with re-materialization processes that can embody the material imprint and energy traces of computational processes, to raise awareness of the physical reality of digital technology through artistic experiences.

**Summary** : The development of information technology, in a context of dematerialization of information, has instigated the digital into a world of immateriality. The miniaturization and complexity of the logical and physical layers of digital technologies have led, to some extent, to a noticeable lack of hardware on the user's side. Focusing on an algorithmic approach, essentially based on code and sign, digital processing of information has led to a distancing from its material and energetic components. Given the current environmental context, the energy consumption and material resources inherent in digital infrastructures today draw attention to the paradoxes of the immaterial condition of digital data. 

Within the framework of an art research project, the challenges of representing digital materialities and computational processes are articulated through the practical application of artistic devices. This thesis aims to forge the notion of “dataphany” through experimentation with artifacts that reveal and implement the physical phenomena on which data processing is based. By clarifying this notion, we propose to reconnect with an awareness-raising experience of the physical imprint and energy traces of computational processes through visual and aesthetic operations.
