The MRC _Behavioral Objects_ is an introduction to robotics designed for third-year students at the École des Arts Décoratifs.

In this Research and Creation Module, we propose that students explore the notion of "behavioral objects", both in its historical and theoretical roots, and through practice in the fields of art and design. Students will use a prototyping tool - the MisB KIT, a modular robotics kit we've developed to create and experiment with behavioral objects. The use of this kit will enable students to familiarize themselves with robotics around notions of interaction and collective expressiveness, while embedding this reflection within their own creative process.
