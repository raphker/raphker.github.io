Episode 4 _Arts and sciences (4/11): making the digital imprint visible._

"How can we poetically express the waves - Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G - that flow through us? And, more broadly, what can science contribute to art? Raphaëlle Kerbrat, artist and doctoral student at ENSADLAB, the research laboratory of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, has made digital art her creative and research field. As part of her thesis, she is taking part in the Reflective Interaction program, directed by artist-teacher-researcher Samuel Bianchini and supported by the Daniel and Nina Carasso Foundation's arts and sciences chair. She takes us through the impalpable traces of the digital world."

Interview with Raphaëlle Kerbrat, visual artist and researcher, and Hugo Scurto, postdoctoral researcher at EUR ArTeC (Université Paris 8 / EnsadLab). Thanks to Christophe Pornay, ENSADLAB stage manager, Rémi Sagot-Duvauroux, Julie Sauret.
