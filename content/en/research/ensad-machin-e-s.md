The _Machin.e.s_ workshop is an introduction to electronics for first-year students at the École des Arts Décoratifs.

Students are invited to manipulate and build electronic objects, graphics and sound, with entirely hardware-based programming (based on NE555s), to learn how to read and write a circuit, programming logic and how the various components work.
