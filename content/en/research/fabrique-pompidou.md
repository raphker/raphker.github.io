How can we create objects inspired by the living world that, through their movement, give the impression of being alive and even of behaving? In connection with the exhibition "La Fabrique du vivant" (Mutations/Créations 3) and with EnsadLab, the research laboratory of the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, La Fabrique invests the field of the living by proposing to explore, through practice, the notion of "behavior", following a bioinspired approach and using the MisB KIT, a modular robotics kit developed by Ensadlab's Reflective Interaction group. Whether it's good, bad or strange behavior, the budding researchers, scientists, artists or designers of tomorrow will have plenty to experiment with, starting with the plant-inspired material Velcro, which is at the heart of this astonishing modular robotics kit for which children can also design and animate their own parts.
