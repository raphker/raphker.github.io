Intensive workshop with students from the Master ArTeC - Université Paris 8, as part of the Fabrique des interfaces class.

_Coordination: Emanuele Quinz_

 The aim of the intensive workshop, which will involve building anti-machines, objects with behaviors, using the MisBkit modular robotics kit designed by the _Reflective Interaction group_  at EnsadLAb (École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs), will be to encourage reflection through practice. In particular, it will test, through direct experimentation, the notion of behavior in an environment that is not only physical, but also defined as a social horizon, associating human and non-human.
