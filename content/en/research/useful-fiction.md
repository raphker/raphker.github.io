"Useful Fictions" is a arts-design-science summer workshop dedicated to constructing new ecological narratives: via workshops, conferences and a final exhibition, the aim is to implement and practice contemporary questioning of our living and technological environments.

_Initiated by the Chaire arts & sciences in 2019 (in partnership with UC Davis1), this biennial summer workshop takes place this year in Poitiers, from July 4 to 11, 2021, under the title "Prendre racine" - Useful Fictions 2._
